#Runthrough of learnyounode tutorial
This tutorial was provided by
[nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers). This was much more thorough
than [javascripting](https://github.com/emilabraham/javascripting). We covered a
lot of core javascript/Node.js concepts, like:

* Asynchronous IO
* Modularity
* Callback functions

I learned a ton and I recommend this tutorial for anyone who is just starting
with Node.js.
